        <h1>My Life Outside of School</h1>
        <h3 class="long">I have enjoyed pole vaulting on our high school track team. I cleared 8ft at the regional finals and am excited to continue through all 4 years of high school. I went to bottlerock in Napa, California and saw Lizzo and Thee Sacred Souls. I helped fix up a house in Oakland as a part of the Piedmont Community Service Crew and I enjoyed meeting the people that live there. As I have mentioned in my school project page, I enjoy taking photos of cars that I see on the street and giving them dark lighting to bring out the deep colors. The last picture in the gif (again, pronounced jif) is a photo of a plate of strawberry shortcake I had at a party with my friends.</h3>
