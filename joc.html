        <h1>Python 3.11</h1>
        <h3>Python 3.11 just came out! the new version is around 25% faster on average during runtime. This is a huge improvement and will likely continue to grow in the near future. </h3>

        <h3>Despite Python's new amazing runtimes, data scientists have run into a couple of problems with the new version. There aren't as many compatible binary packages as before, so certain files don't work as intended.</h3>

        <h3>With these changes made to the new version of Python, programming has become more accessible towards children. They are able to toy with a little script on a laptop to give them a better understanding of computer science as a whole.</h3>

        <h3>Even without the new Python 3.11 update, the job market flourishes with jobs available for python engineers. Wether it's data science, engineering, to AI development. Python is there.</h3>

            <h4>This project is called Lawn Lions 2. I enjoyed this project because of the creativity we had to employ to differentiate our projects from one anothers. I like modded cars so I put some modded beetles in a parking lot.</h3>

            <h4>This project is called Idols 2. I enjoyed this project because of the creativity involved. We had very little parameters and were given a lot of freedom on what we could do. I chose my favorite childhood show and I thought of the hole in a mug as a window for gumball to sit in.</h4>
